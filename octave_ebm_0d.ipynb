    "The implementation of the global (“zero-dimensional”) energy balance model in MATLAB/Octave may be based on version 5 of the “solar heating model”. First create a new directory `Ebm0D` on your computer. Then copy the M-file script `solar_heating5.m` to this directory and rename it to `ebm_0d.m`. Copy the M-file function `run_model.m` and the M-file script `plot_results.m` as well. Finally, open MATLAB/Octave and change to `Ebm0D` as your `Current Directory`. "

    "Eventually, you can run the M-file script `ebm_0d.m` on the command line of the Command Window in GNU Octave. Check for possible errors and return to the Editor in GNU Octave to inspect the code lines in the respetcive file. Correct the errors and rerun `ebm_0d.m`. If you cannot detect all errors yourself, carefully compare your code to the code segments in this notebook. If all else fail, you may then turn to the next [notebook](octave_ebm_0d_complete_code.ipynb) that provides the entire code of the zero-dimensional enegry balance model. However, it is highly recommend to first try yourself, which helps you to gain a deeper understanding of writing, testing and correcting a program (this process is called \"debugging\") and gives you a much greater satisfaction than just copying provided code."
